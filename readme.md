# YelpCamp

### Developed an E-commerce Campground website where a user needs to create an account to add their campgrounds to the website. Anyone without the login credentials can still view the campgrounds listed. Once logged in, the application allows user to perform CRUD (Create, Remove, Update and Delete) operations. The application supports MVC architecture where controller is optimized by RESTFUL routing while Embedded.js is used as view and Mongo DB as a model, making this application as SEO-friendly.

### Steps to Run the application

* Clone the repository.
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Rakhee06/Kickstart.git
```
* Follow the below steps.
```sh
$ cd YelpCamp
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
* Above steps will start the server at `localhost:3000`

### Tech

Kickstart uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
 
* Express.js
* Embedded.js
* Mongo DB
* HTML
* CSS
